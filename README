pre-run: 
1, lmp2pdb.py data.data (generate .psf and .pdb for post-processing)
2, makepair will generate a pair_potential file for you, revise it if needed.
#2, after .dcd loaded by vmd: source doit.tcl

run:
1, runlist.bash

post-run:
you can use the following cli to see your data-fig:
1, readlog.py
2, create_html.bash
   dependencies:
   a, draw_data.gpl 
      please note, tempdata.gpl needed, 
      so actually these 2 are important and portable for any drawing)  
   b, showdata.bash
*, topology of the usage:
               / create_html.bash
   readlog.py {
               \ getstress.py
   rdf.bash (.psf needed, using lmp2pdb.py)
   contact.bash (.psf needed, using lmp2pdb.py) 
just hit them in your command line to see 'how to'
e.g.:
 ./readlog.py example.log
 ./create_html.bash example.gnuplot.dat (this file is created by the last command)
or 
 ./readlog.py example.log Step example.inputfornextcmd 
 ./create_html.bash example.inputfornextcmd

./clean.bash will do purge for this command, use it carefully.

3, rdf.bash
4, avevol.py (to see energy-volume and create the volume.in for the next deform.in if needed)
Attention:

1, for the [keyword], we shall set it the 1st keyword of dump keywords in your .log file, normally "Step"
2, nothing more so far...
