To get the newest version:

    wget https://github.com/scottie33/amorphous_polymer_lammps/archive/master.zip 

**HINT**: just hit any command mentioned above in the command line to see 'how to' ~

\[currently dir **oneNP** will show you a protocol of a huge NP (scaled as the RG of ea. polymer) with polymers.\]

----

### pre-run: 

*1*\[goto 3\], lmp2pdb.py data.data (generate .psf and .pdb for post-processing)

*2*\[don't use this when system's compressed too much\], after .dcd loaded by vmd: source doit.tcl

**3**, **protocol** to initialization of the system:

    a: random-NP.py | cubic-NP.py (revise it mannually)
    [before mc_gen, please delete NP.dat if there's no NanoParticle in your system]
    b: mc_gen.bash [make_mc_gen.x] [mc_gen] (revise .input whenever needed)
    c: makepair001.py | makepair_expand.py
       mv pairfile **pairfile_rep** (do all the repel for minimization)
       mv pairfile **pairfile_no_soft** (for the rest of the protocol, please do not ask why...)

----

### run:

#### 1, runlist.bash

---

### post-run:

you can use the following cli to see your data-fig:

#### 1, read the logfile:

    readlog.py

**NOTE**: for the \[keyword\], we shall set it the 1st keyword of dump keywords in your .log file, normally "Step"

#### 2, see the result of logfile by view:

    create_html.bash
    [ dependencies: ]
    a, draw_data.gpl 
        [ please note, tempdata.gpl needed, 
        [ so actually these 2 are important and portable for any drawing) ]
    b, showdata.bash

**HOW-TO**:

e.g.:

    readlog.py example.log
    create_html.bash example.gnuplot.dat (this file is created by the last command)

or:

    readlog.py example.log Step example.inputfornextcmd 
    create_html.bash example.inputfornextcmd

Topology of the usage:

                / create_html.bash
    readlog.py {
                \ getstress.py
    rdf.bash -> allpeak.py -> getpdb.bash (.psf needed, using lmp2pdb.py to generate it)
    contact.bash (.psf needed, using lmp2pdb.py to generate it) 
    allpeak.py [ need explanation ]
    getpdb.bash (.psf ... )
    getrogyr.bash
    amongpdb.bash

clean.bash will do purge for this command, use it carefully.

avevol.py (to see energy-volume and create the volume.in for the next deform.in if needed)

Attention:

**3**, please be noted: trajectoy_analyze.tcl is great for the analysis of trajectory loaded in VMD, read the source for the example.


### O(ne) C(lick) S(eries): Lammps .log file.

Dependencies: bash, tcl, python, gnuplot, VMD;

Comman Line Format : cmd log-filename.

Description: you will have a .html (or all figures in .eps) of the information you are able to get from .log from a Lammps production run.
